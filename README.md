## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently a CS major @Georgia Tech and is excited to implement ML/DL frameworks into the industry to create real-world impact. Over the past three years, I've been actively deplying ML/DL theories to classify EEG brain signals for mental health diagnosis; these tasks are performed using PyTorch and TensorFlow and the results (accuracy, recall rate, AUC) are all published in IEEE conferences. 
## I'm open to research positions as well as AI/software engineering jobs in the US. Feel free to reach out at yonglineo@gmail.com!
